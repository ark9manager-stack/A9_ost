[00:22.89]Flashback of the memory that
[00:26.02]Show up in my dream
[00:28.17]I wake up at midnight and tears are fallinʼ
[00:31.73]I was trying to reach out for somebody
[00:36.14]I was hiding till you wrap your arms around me
[00:40.62]I drew a picture of you I used to know
[00:45.16]Still donʼt recall the color of curtains on the window
[00:49.81]Remember looking down for the missing piece of stone
[00:54.19]But I can see it clear now
[00:56.58]Iʼm writing my way
[00:58.78]Every time with the season
[01:01.05]I change and Iʼm turning
[01:03.23]Every night has a reason
[01:05.43]I promise you sunrise
[01:07.86]But stand up no going back
[01:12.15]Everyday I try finding
[01:14.53]the light of your star
[01:35.39]Flashback of the memory how
[01:38.43]Young 22 with you
[01:40.58]So much to carry through I used to fall for the night I cried till I lost myself in the sea
[01:48.50]Side by side you had gone right before me
[01:53.12]The colors of the rainbow never in the row
[01:57.69]At spring the flower bloom and summer came in blue
[02:02.25]No control of time but still wanna follow you
[02:06.57]keep walking up the mountains Iʼm riding my way
[02:11.14]Every time with the season
[02:13.46]I change and Iʼm turning
[02:15.64]Every night has a reason
[02:17.86]I promise you sunrise
[02:20.34]But stand up no going back
[02:24.68]Everyday I try finding
[02:26.92]the light of your star
[02:29.25](Every time with the season)
[02:31.46]Iʼm ready to start
[02:34.37]Iʼm looking up for you
[02:38.41](Every night has a reason)
[02:40.66]Stand up no going back
[02:43.09]Iʼm searching for a sign of you
[02:47.12]Every time with the season
[02:49.64]I change and Iʼm turning
[02:52.08]Every night has a reason I promise you sunrise
[02:56.50]But stand up no going back
[03:00.75]Everyday I try finding
[03:03.10]the light of your star
[03:05.45]Every time with the season
[03:07.77]I change and Iʼm turning
[03:10.03]Every night has a reason
[03:12.21]I promise you sunrise
[03:14.64]But stand up no going back
[03:19.09]Everyday I try finding
[03:21.18]the light of your star
[03:23.58]Every time with the season
[03:25.82]I change and Iʼm turning
[03:28.14]Every night has a reason I promise you sunrise
[03:32.73]But stand up no going back
[03:37.16]Everyday I try finding
[03:39.15]the light of your star
