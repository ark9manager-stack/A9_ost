[00:03.449]Our shadows fall
[00:06.711]Where truth was once earned
[00:10.827]We won't forget
[00:14.105]The lessons we learned
[00:18.368]Petals bloom
[00:21.503]But they won't amend
[00:25.901]Drawn again into your wind
[01:02.833]Our shadows fall
[01:05.889]Where truth was once earned
[01:09.823]We won't forget
[01:13.289]The lessons we learned
[01:17.427]Petals bloom
[01:20.590]But they won't amend
[01:24.708]Drawn again into your wind
