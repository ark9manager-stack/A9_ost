[00:03.01]Our shadows fall
[00:06.01]Where truth was once earned
[00:10.01]We won't forget
[00:14.01]The lessons we learned
[00:18.01]Petals bloom
[00:21.01]But they won't amend
[00:25.01]Drawn again into your wind
[01:02.33]Our shadows fall
[01:05.29]Where truth was once earned
[01:09.23]We won't forget
[01:13.28]The lessons we learned
[01:17.27]Petals bloom
[01:20.09]But they won't amend
[01:24.08]Drawn again into your wind
